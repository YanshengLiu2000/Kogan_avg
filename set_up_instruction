This script is writen by python3.6.

All libs I used in this script can be find in basic python3.6.
You don't need to install other libs.

Before you run it, please open it first and change the line 9 & 10.
    prefix = 'http://wp8m3he1wt.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com'
    suffix = '/api/products/1'

URL in the script should be divided into two parts.
Suffix part can be find in every ["next"] of the page.
And the prefix is the constant part of each pages' url.

After changing this, just open a terminal and
    python3 avg.py
    or
    python avg.py
